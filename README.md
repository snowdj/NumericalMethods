Contents
--------

* Lectures: this directory contains the lecture slides used (originally beamer PDFs) converted to IPython notebooks, with all examples converted to completed code. Level of detail very variable, and the order is slightly odd as it conflates two sets of lectures. (Order revised for 2014/15 year)

* Worksheets: this directory contains worksheets used for formative purposes.

* Notes: The pdf notes (in one file) used as background material.
