\chapter{Key Mathematical Results}

There are a number of key results that you are expected to know. These
will have been covered in previous courses. For rigorous statements
and proofs you should consult books on the reading list or basic
calculus or linear algebra texts.

\section{Linear Algebra}

A vector $\bv$ of length $N$ is a set of $N$ numbers ordered either as
a row or column. In either case the notation $v_i$ is used to denote
the coefficients.

The dot product of a row vector $\bx$ with a column vector $\by$ is
given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_la1}
  \bx \cdot \by = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot y_i.
\end{equation}

A matrix $A$ of size $N$ is a set of $N^2$ numbers ordered into $N$
rows and $N$ columns. These numbers are called the coefficients,
denoted $a_{ij}$, $i$ indicating the row and $j$ the column.

Matrix-matrix multiplication written $A B = C$ defines the
coefficients of the matrix $C$ in terms of the (given) matrix
coefficients of $A$ and $B$ by
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_la2}
  c_{ij} = \sum_{l = 1}^n a_{i l} b_{l j}.
\end{equation}
%
In other words, the $c_{ij}$ coefficient is given by the dot product
of the $i^{\text{th}}$ row of $A$ with the $j^{\text{th}}$ column of
$B$.

Matrix-vector multiplication $A \bx = \bb$ defines the coefficients of
the column vector $\bb$ in terms of the gives matrix $A$ and column
vector $\bx$; as expected this is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_la3}
  b_{i} = \sum_{l = 1}^n a_{i l} x_{l}.
\end{equation}

The system of linear equations $A \bx = \bb$ where $A, \bb$ are known
and $\bx$ is unknown, has a unique solution if, and only if, the
determinant of the matrix $A$ is non-zero.

Eigenvectors of a matrix $A$ are any vector $\bx$ such that $A \bx =
\lambda \bx$. The value $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue. Eigenvalues
can be found from the characteristic polynomial $\det(A - \lambda I) =
0$, where $I$ is the $N \times N$ identity matrix (this is not a
practical way of computing eigenvalues when $N$ is
large). Eigenvectors are only defined up to a multiplicative constant
(i.e., if $\bx$ is an eigenvector then $\alpha \bx$ is an eigenvector
with the same eigenvalue, provided $\alpha \ne 0$).

A \emph{basis} is a set of $N$ independent vectors $\be_i$ such that
any vector $\bx$ can be expressed as a linear combination
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_la4}
  \bx = \alpha_1 \be_1 + \dots \alpha_N \be_N.
\end{equation}
%
A particularly useful case is when the eigenvectors of a matrix $A$
form a basis.

\section{Taylor's theorem}

If $f$ is a continuous function on $x \in [a, b]$ and the
$(n+1)^{\text{th}}$ derivative exists on $(a, b)$, then for any point
$c \in [a, b]$, we can express $f(x)$ (for any point $x \in [a, b]$)
as
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_taylor}
  f(x) = \left\{\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!} f^{(k)}(c) \, (x - c)^k
  \right\} + E_n(x),
\end{equation}
%
where, for some point $\xi$ between $c$ and $x$, the \emph{error} or
\emph{remainder} $E_n$ can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_taylor2}
  E_n(x) = \frac{1}{(n+1)!} f^{(n+1)}(\xi) \, (x - c)^{n+1}.
\end{equation}
%
Here the notation $f^{(n)}$ means the $n^{\text{th}}$ derivative of
$f$.

For our purposes, the most useful way of writing this will be in the
form of a Maclaurin series where $c=0$. We shall also often consider
cases where $x \rightarrow h$, $|h| \ll 1$, leading to
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_taylor3}
  f(h) = f(0) + h f^{(1)}(0) + \frac{h^2}{2} f^{(2)}(0) +
  \frac{h^3}{3!} f^{(3)}(0) + \dots + \order{h^n}.
\end{equation}
%
The notation $\order{h^n}$ means that the remaining terms contain
powers of $h$ at least as big as $n$; when $h$ is small it is usually
reasonable to neglect these terms.

\section{Triangle inequality}

For any normed vector space $V$ with elements $\bx, \by \in V$, the
triangle inequality states that
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_triangle}
  \| \bx + \by \| \leq \| \bx \| + \| \by \|.
\end{equation}

For our purposes we will mostly be concerned with real numbers where
$\| \bx \|$ has the simple interpretation as the absolute value of the
number $x$. In this case the triangle inequality simply says that the
sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than
or equal to the length of the remaining side.

\section{Difference equations}

For linear constant coefficient ODEs
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_DE}
  a_n y^{(n)}(x) + \dots + a_1 y^{(1)}(x) + a_0 y(x) = 0
\end{equation}
%
there is a simple solution method in terms of the \emph{characteristic
polynomial}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_DE2}
  a_n \lambda^n + \dots + a_1 \lambda + a_0 = 0.
\end{equation}
%
The characteristic polynomial follows from substituting the assumption
$y(x) = \exp[\lambda x]$ into equation~(\ref{eq:key_DE}); $\lambda$ is
then a root of the characteristic polynomial. The general solution is
the general linear combination of all solutions found from the
characteristic polynomial. Note that repeated roots complicate the
analysis slightly.

The same approach can be used for \emph{difference equations}. These
are equations that define sequences (of e.g.\ real numbers or
vectors), usually written in the form
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_DE3}
  a_k y_n + \dots + a_1 y_{n-k+1} + a_0 y_{n-k} = 0.
\end{equation}
%
Substituting the assumption $y_n = \lambda^n$ gives the characteristic
polynomial
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_DE4}
  a_n \lambda^n + \dots + a_1 \lambda + a_0 = 0.
\end{equation}
%
Assuming all roots are distinct, the solution is a linear combination
of the simple solutions $\lambda^n$. If $\mu$ is a root with
multiplicity $k$ then the sequences
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:key_DE5}
  y^{\{l\}}_n = \dv[(l-1)]{}{\lambda} \left[
    \lambda^n \right], \quad l = 0, \dots, k
\end{equation}
%
are all solutions.

For our purposes the key is that for the solution of a difference
equation to be \emph{bounded} (i.e., $y_n$ is bounded as $n \rightarrow
\infty$) we need all roots $\lambda$ to satisfy $|\lambda| \le 1$ (and
if the root is repeated we need $|\lambda| < 1$).
