Micromagnetism example taken from

The visualisation below is that of the magnetisation of a
ferromagnetic sphere of radius 200nm at zero applied field. The colour
scale represents the angle between the x and y components of the
magnetisation; the streamlines represent tracers which have been
dropped in to highlight the vortex state.
