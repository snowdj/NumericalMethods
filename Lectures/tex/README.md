# README

These are the LaTeX beamer slides I actually use in the lectures.

Note that to actually make them compile you'll need the style files in the
`styles` subdirectory. You'll also want to find or comment out the logo file.
The additional shell script and header file is for compiling the handout
versions of the notes (can't remember who/where I got this trick from). All
these files need to be somewhere in your tex path, and you'll need to modify
the paths in the scripts.

The `codes` directory includes some of the scripts from live-coding in 2016/17.
As ever, I did this completely differently in 2017/18, and it's different to the
code in the notebooks and the solutions to the worksheets. Any will work.
