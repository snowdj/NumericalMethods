# Schedule

Revised for 2017/18 based on the 2016/17 lectures, as from Panopto.

1. Introduction
2. Linear Systems (condition number)
3. Direct Methods (Gauss elimination)
4. Decomposition Methods (LU)
5. Iterative methods (*NEW*: split in two. Add convergence, move GS+ to next)
6. Iterative methods 2
7. Nonlinear root finding
8. Functional iteration
9. Speed of convergence
10. Stability of iterative methods
11. Systems of nonlinear equations
12. Quadrature and trapezoidal rule (*THINK*: split this? Add more on interpolation here? Then put the error analysis in its own lecture, go through in detail on the board? Then split next lecture as well?)
13. Simpson's rule and Richardson extrapolation
14. Adaptive and Gauss Quadrature
15. IVPs and Euler's Method
16. Euler PC and errors (*NEW*: split in two. Split after the global error theorem (around slide 12). Or do one lecture on theory, on on EPC and RK implementations)
17. Euler PC and errors
18. Multistep methods
19. Implicit multistep methods and accuracy (*THINK*: cut stuff?)
20. Stability of multistep methods (*THINK*: cut stuff?)
21. BVPs and shooting
22. Finite differences for BVPs
23. Finite differences and nonlinear relaxation (*NEW* split from previous)
24. Function Basis methods
25. Linear PDEs and elliptic equations
26. Evolutionary PDE problems (?T?S methods)
27. Von Neumann stability
28. Von Neumann stability 2 (*NEW* split from previous. Lecture 1 just does FTCS, heat: lecture 2 covers the rest)
29. Upwind methods
